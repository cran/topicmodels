Changes in topicmodels version 0.0-7

  o The control for topic models now also has a seed argument to
    ensure reproducibility of results and a estimate.beta argument
    which can be used to fix the term distribution over topics after
    initialization.

  o The control for Gibbs sampling allows to specify to return
    repeated draws in a list using arguments burnin, thin and iter.

  o In slot beta for class "TopicModel" the log parameters are stored
    to have a higher accuracy for the VEM code if parameter values are
    close to zero.

  o Call to assert removed in C code to avoid termination of R.

  o TopicModel now has a slot loglikelihood. For models fitted using
    Gibbs sampling this contains the loglikelihood of the corpus, for
    VEM fitted models the vector of loglikelihoods for each document
    separately.

  o Memory bug fixed in returnObjectGibbsLDA.
